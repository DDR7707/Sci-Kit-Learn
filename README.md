* Creating Train and Test data.

* Choosing the correct model to the data.

* Fitting the model to our data and making predictions.

* Evaluating our model performance.

* Tuning hyperparameters for a better model.

* Saving and loading the model for the future use.

* Putting all together in one block using pipeline module.
